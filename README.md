> Peer-to-peer volunteer platform of Extinction Rebellion: an international, grassroots, decentralized movement of tens of thousands of people who act together to justly address one of the greatest crisis of our times.

## Purpose

### why rebel

We are developers who joined Extinction Rebellion because we feel a moral duty to use our knowledge and skills to solve the Climate and Ecological Emergency. This emergency is a present reality for the families who are labelled climate refugees, the indigenous communities whose land has been destroyed, and the countless species that are forced into extinction every day. Governments have failed to act and are driving us towards social and ecollogical collapse. We joined Extinction Rebellion because it is our best and last hope to protect life on Earth.

### why this project

We are developing this volunteer platform to make it easier for Extinction Rebellion groups to find help with roles and tasks, and easier for people to find roles and tasks in Extinction Rebellion that they wish to volunteer for. We believe that this platform is a critical tool to grow the movement, make it more resilient, and increase our chances of addressing the pressing crisis.

But we cannot do it alone. No matter who you are, what skills you have or how much time you can dedicate, we need your help. In the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) you can learn how you can contribute to the project.
