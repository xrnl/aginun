## Join project meetings

Every other Wednesday at 17:30 (in the
[CEST](https://24timezones.com/time-zone/cest)/[CET](https://24timezones.com/time-zone/cet)
timezone, depending on the season) we hold a brief and efficient online meeting
to review the progress from the previous 2 weeks, resolve questions about
current work, discuss ideas and set goals for the next two weeks. We would like
to invite you to this meeting so that you can meet the team, share your ideas
and get a warm welcome to the project. You can join the online meeting using
[this link](https://meet2.organise.earth/b/tec-cu9-9tr) on the next Tuesday that
lands on an [even week number](https://www.epochconverter.com/weeknumbers).

## Report a problem

If you have found a problem in the application, fisrt search [the project
issues](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
to see if it has already been reported. If the problem hasn't been reported,
[create a new issue reporting a problem](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues/new?labels=bug&template=report-a-problem.md).

After you submit the issue explaining your problem, you are very welcome to help
solve the problem. In the section [contributing to the
code](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-to-the-code)
you can learn how. 

## Request a feature

If you have an idea for a feature to improve the application, first search the
[open issues](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues) and the [future
functionalities](https://github.com/xrnl/agiinun/wiki/Future-functionalities)
page to see if your idea has already been suggested. If you can't find anything,
create a [new issue requesting a feature](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues/new?labels=suggestion&template=request-a-feature.md).

After you submit your feature request, a project maintainer will give you one of
the following answers within 2 days:

- The feature will be implemented in the current version. In this case you can
  directly start [developing your feature](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-to-the-code).
- The feature will be implemented in a future version. In this case you are
  encouraged not to develop your proposed feature, and instead develop features
  assigned to the next version, as these have a higher priority.
- The feature will not be implemented. The project maintainer will explain why
  it won't be implemented so that you can understand the decision and appeal the
  decision if you still think your suggestion should be implemented.

## Contribute to the code

### Prerequisites

First of all, make sure you are familiar with [the
technologies](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/wiki/Architecture#technologies) we
use in this application. Of course, you don't need to know all of them, only the
ones you need for developing the part of the application that you want to work
on.

#### How to contribute without prior experience

Don't worry if you don't have prior experience with these technologies!
Contributing to the development of an application is the best way to learn. We
recommend that you first learn the basics using the documentation of each
technology. Then apply what you learned to resolve one of the [good first
issues](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22next+version%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
When you submit your change, more experienced developers will give you
constructive feedback and aid you in your learning.

#### How to contribute with other technical skills

If you have experience with technologies that are not used in this application,
you can still use them in other tech projects of Extinction Rebellion. Please
[get in contact](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/blob/master/SUPPORT.md) to learn
about available opportunities!

### Where to contribute best

All features of the application are specified in the [functional
specification](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/wiki/Functional-Specification).
From this specifcation, the
[roadmap](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/wiki/Roadmap) for the next version of
the application is created. For each feature of the next version, a [Github
issue](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues) is created with a milstone
assigned to that version.

- You can contribute best by resolving [issues assigned to the next version](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22next+version%22).
  Within these issues: 
  - Issues with the [bug](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22next+version%22+label%3Abug)
  label have the highest priority.  
  - Issues with the [enhancement](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22next+version%22+label%3Aenhancement)
  label have the lowest priority.
- If it is your first time contributing, a good place to start is to resolve
  [good first issues](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22next+version%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

If you plan to start working on an issue, please leave a comment in that issue
so others do not inadvertently work on it at the same time.

### How to contribute

#### 1: Install and run the application

You can install and run the application by following the intructions in the
[README](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun#install).

#### 2: Follow the Development model

In this project, we use the _fork and pull_ [collaborative development
model](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models)
to collaboratively change the code. If you haven't worked with this model
before, we recommend following [this
guide](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/).

#### 3: Make your changes

Once you have installed the application and it is configured according to the
_fork and pull_ model, you can make your changes to the code.

#### 4: Test your code

It is highly recommended that you write unit tests for any code you submit. This
will help ensure that any code you write works as expected, and will make it
easy to identify if any future changes breaks your code.

#### 5: Make sure all tests pass

Before submitting your change, you need to make sure that they do not break
existing functionality. To do that, [run all
tests](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun#test) and fix your code if any of the
tests do not pass.

#### 6: Lint and Prettify code

Any code you submit must:

- Not have any errors detectable by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint
  enables us to easily detect and solve common problems in our code.
- Be formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). We use prettier to have a
  consistent and automatic code formatting without having to memorize and follow
  a style guide.

To easily write code that meets these requirements, we recommend using [this
setup](https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/wiki/Recommended-setup).

#### 7: Make a pull request

When your code is ready to be submitted, make a pull request with the following
details:

1. Merge into the `master` branch of the `xrnl` repository.
2. Reference any issues that this pull request closes, using one of the [Github issue linking keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
3. Explain all changes you have made in this pull request. If this pull request
   changes the interface you should include screenshots of the interface before
   and after your changes.
4. Explain why you have made these changes.
5. Explain parts of the code that might be difficult to understand. This makes
   it much easier for the maintainer to review your code.

When you submit or update your pull request, you should receive a reply within 2
days. If the reviewer request changes, you should repeat steps 3 to 6. Note that
you don't need to make a new pull request. You can push to your branch and the
pull request will be automatically updated with your latest changes.
